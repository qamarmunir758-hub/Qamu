Dear GitHub Support Team,
​My name is Qamar Munir Chaudhari, and I am a self-taught developer from Pakistan. I am writing to you because I am working on a mission-driven project, and I hope GitHub can support me in making it a success.
​I am an individual living with low vision, and due to financial constraints and limited formal education, I have had to learn everything on my own. Using free AI tools like Gemini and ChatGPT, I have successfully developed a blueprint and the initial code for an app designed to help people with similar challenges—bridging the gap between non-technical users and modern technology.
​About the Project:
My app is a "Real Agent" tool focused on accessibility and high-level security. I have specifically built tight security layers to protect vulnerable users from hackers and phishing attacks. You can find my full blueprint and code in this link: [https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rMHT173rLmAl3yDlFOXE8B99z6uIE8OT/view?usp=drivesdk]
​Why I am reaching out to GitHub:
I am doing this alone and with very limited resources. I am seeking your guidance, tools, or any available support that can help me develop this further into a professional-grade application. This project is not just a solution for others, but also a hope for my own financial future.
​Accessibility Request:
Because of my low vision, I find it much easier to communicate via voice. If there is any possibility of a voice meeting or receiving guidance via audio, it would greatly help me understand and respond more effectively.
​I have put my heart and soul into this project, and with GitHub’s support, I believe I can truly make a difference.
